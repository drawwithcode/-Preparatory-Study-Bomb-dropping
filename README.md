# Bomb-Dropping (simple implementation) ✈️ 💣 💣 💣 
This sketch is a preparatory study which demonstrates how to simulate elements dropping from the top.
No gravitational accelleration is implemented.
[Demo](https://drawwithcode.github.io/Bomb-Dropping/).

## How it works:
Everytimes the user performs a click, an array is updated and a new element is added.
Those elements correspond to the bombs falling from the top of the window.
The X positions remain the same, while the Y positions are updated each time the DRAW is called.
An ellipse is then drawn depending on those coordinates.
